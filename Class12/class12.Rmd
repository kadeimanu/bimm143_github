# Section 1. Proportion of G/G in a population 

Downloaded a CSV file from Ensemble < https://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Sample?db=core;r=17:39770110-40020111;v=rs8067378;vdb=variation;vf=959672880#373531_tablePanel >

Here we read this CSV file

```{r}
mxl <- read.csv("373531-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
head(mxl)
```

```{r}
table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.)
```


```{r}
table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(mxl) *100
```

Now let's look at a different population, GBR.

```{r}
gbr <- read.csv("373522-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
head(gbr)
```

Find the proportion of G/G

```{r}
round(table(gbr$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(gbr) * 100, 2)
```

This variant that is associated with childhood asthma is more frequent in the GBR population than the MXL population. 

Lets now dig into this further. 


## Section 4: Population Scale Analysis 
One sample is obviously not enough to kow what is happening in a population.  You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale.  

So, you proceed about 
~230 samples and did the normalization on a genome level.  Now, you want to find whether there is any association of the 4 asthma- associated SNPs (rs8067378...)on ORMDL3 expression. 

How many smaples do we have? 


> Q13. Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
 expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```
```{r}
nrow(expr)
```
```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
tapply(expr$exp, expr$geno, median, na.rm = TRUE)

```
median expression of A/A is 31.25, for A/G its 25.06 and for G/G its 20.07. 

> Q14. Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

Lets make a boxplot 

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + aes(geno, exp, fill= geno)+
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)+
  stat_summary(fun= median)
```

Yes different genotypes, A/A, A/g and G/G effects the expression of ORMDL3, we can see in this boxplot that G/G is associated with lower gene expression of this gene then A/A and A/G.
